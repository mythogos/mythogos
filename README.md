# Mythogos (Mythos + Logos)

If there was a Creator behind this universe, they didn‚Äôt just summon it into being - they coded it.  
Somewhere beneath the chaos, there‚Äôs a language. A logic. A hidden syntax that breathes form into matter and order into motion.

Language, in all its shapes, is how we reach into that unknown.  
Not just to speak - but to think, to remember, to pass fire from one mind to another.

The philosopher asks questions with words.  
The scientist maps laws in equations.  
The artist whispers through color, rhythm, silence.  
The engineer drafts, builds, compiles.

I write code.

Not just to make things work - but to make sense of things.  
It's how I explore, how I create, how I leave a trace.

And this project?  
Just one fragment of the code I‚Äôm still writing.

## üß≠ What is this?

This is a terminal-based program - written in C, rendered in ASCII, that simulates **the hidden algorithms** of existence.

Each module is a small window into one of those primal logics:
- A rule that governs growth, motion, structure, or chaos
- A piece of logic that echoes the way the world seems to breathe, organize, or collapse
- A question in disguise, wrapped in movement

You don‚Äôt just **see** how it works - You **read the source**, tweak the code, trace the law back to its core.

This is not a productivity tool.  
This is not a game.  
This is a **cabinet of digital creation myths** - and you hold the keys.

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Examples of modules

| Module         | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `life`         | A cellular automaton - life from nothing but a rule      |
| `flock`        | Boids - how order emerges from individuals in motion     |
| `maze`         | A* pathfinding - how a choice becomes a journey          |
| `fractal`      | Infinite complexity - zoom until meaning disappears      |
| `ant`          | Langton‚Äôs Ant - chaos gives birth to patterns            |

More will come. Or maybe they've always been there.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why ASCII?

Because simplicity reveals structure.
Because the rawest tools often yield the clearest form.

It‚Äôs about language as abstraction - where complex worlds collapse into simple symbols,
and symbols become the bridge between thought and form.

ASCII is not a limitation.
It is a deliberate constraint - a reduction to the primal alphabet of machines,
where every pixel is a character, every frame a verse.

We are not painting the world - we are spelling it into being.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why C?

Because C is close to the machine - and far from the noise.
No frameworks. No dependencies. No corporations whispering behind the compiler.

It speaks in pointers and memory, not abstractions and trends.
It‚Äôs not elegant - it‚Äôs elemental.

C doesn‚Äôt care about you.
It won‚Äôt hold your hand.
It will let you crash, leak, segfault, and burn.
But in doing so, it tells you exactly how the world breaks.

While other languages evolve, expire, or get bought - C survives. 
Like a cockroach. Ugly. Efficient. Undying.

It‚Äôs not the newest, nor the safest, nor the most popular.
But it‚Äôs still here.
And it still runs the heart of every machine you touch.

If we are writing a language to speak with the Creator,
C is the closest thing to whispering directly into the void.

Clone the repo. Compile. Run. Type. Observe. Wonder.  
This isn‚Äôt just software.  
It‚Äôs a **map of the hidden engine** beneath reality.
